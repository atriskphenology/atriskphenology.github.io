## Introduction

Coming soon
{: .label .label-yellow }
We worked with butterfly researchers and naturalists across the United States to find datasets that allowed us to evalute the phenology, or the timing of flight periods, and abundance of butterflies that are of conservation concern.

Scientists have hypothesized that species that get earlier are declining and species that get later are increasing. Species with longer flight periods would be increasing and species with shorter flight periods would be decreasing.

## Methods and Definitions
