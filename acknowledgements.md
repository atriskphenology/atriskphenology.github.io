We have many data contributors and collaborators to thank!

## SERDP Team
Our research was funded by the Department of Defense through the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP, award #RC-2700). This project was lead by Dr. Elizabeth Crone, Dr. Cheryl Schultz, Dr. Diane Debinski, and Dr. Sonia Altizer.

Many were involved in the project as a whole. The portion of the team working on this project is Collin Edwards, Chelsea Thomas, Christopher Jason, Kelsey King, and Kaitlyn Glover (is this all?).
